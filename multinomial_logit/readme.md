multinomial logit files go here

1st Model
-  I accidentally predicted on the train data, instead of the test data.
-  This definitely caused the accuracy to decrease.

2nd Model
- I predicted on the test data and got an improved score.

3rd Model
- I removed the less significant variables but the score did not improve.
